# Voluta

## Overview
Voluta is a simple cURL code editor extension for VS Code. Paste a cURL command, adjust headers or form data, and resend the request without leaving the editor. The workflow centers on testing and debugging REST APIs directly from your coding environment.

## Why the name?
The name nods to the *volute*, the decorative curl on Italian architectural columns, and to the Italian "voluta" meaning "wanted to". Both capture the extension's focus on curls and on intentional, iterative tweaking.

## Inspiration
The workflow takes cues from Firefox's Edit and Resend feature, bringing a similar edit-and-repeat feature and loop into the VS Code workspace.

## Features
- Inline editor that parses existing cURL commands.
- Form and header fields that surface common request tweaks.
- One-click resend to retry endpoints without leaving VS Code.
- History-aware panel for iterating on previous commands.
